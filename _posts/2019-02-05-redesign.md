I'm hard working (ha! 15 minutes a day) on creating simple but beautiful design
for my blog. Btw, it's similar to writing clean code: blog structure should be
simple but powerful enough, everything should work as expected, no code
duplicates accepted, etc.

Nevertheless, I have a vision how it should look like
and when I can stop a say "That's it".
