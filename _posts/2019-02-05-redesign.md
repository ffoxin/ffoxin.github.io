I'm hard working (ha! 15 minutes a day) on creating simple but beautiful design
for my blog. 
<!--more-->
Btw, it's similar to writing clean code: blog structure should be simple but 
powerful enough, everything should work as expected, no code duplicates
accepted, etc.

Nevertheless, I have a vision how it should look like and when I can stop and
say "That's it".
